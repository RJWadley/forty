## A New Post

Well, this is my first blog post. I'm not quite sure where to start.
If you don't know already, I'm on a journey to create an app. It's not exactly the simplest thing in the world. I have a little bit of coding experience mostly in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (and if you don't know what those are, they make websites)

Whatever way this goes, I need to do a bit of research first. There are a few things I need to sort out. 
## Number One
### Android or IOS?

This is always a big decision. Which one to use affects who can use the app. I personally have quite a few friends that use iPhones, and these friends support me in my endeavors, so I don't want to just blatantly leave them out.

On the flipside, I personally use Android (and please don't kill me if you disagree). I have my reasons. I won't like developing an app I can't use.

## Number Two
### Coding Language

What is a coding language (or programming language)?

> A programming language is a vocabulary and set of grammatical rules for instructing a computer or computing device to perform specific tasks.

Another way to think about programming is telling someone to do things.
* If the light is green, go.
* When you reach the door, open it.
* Tell me what 2+2 is.

And a programming language is the way you tell them.
* Go to the bathroom
* Ir al baño
* トイレに行く

They mean the same thing. Understandable? Good.

Here's the thing: IOS and Android use different languages. In order to make them do the same thing, I have to rewrite the app twice. I don't want to do that. At the moment my proposed solution is the following...

## Solution

Remember how earlier I said I had some experience with HTML, CSS, and Javascript? Turns out I might be able to write an app in HTML and package it into an app. Allow me to explain.

I can write an app in HTML. Ever left-clicked and clicked "Inspect"? That stuff you see pop up is HTML. This website is built in HTML, as is pretty much the entire internet.

After I build the app, I can export it to an application format and it will run inside a sort of "secret" web browser, all hidden behind the scenes.

The result? An app that I know how to make, and that my friends can use!

As of right now, this is what I plan to do. As I research, that may change. Who knows?
